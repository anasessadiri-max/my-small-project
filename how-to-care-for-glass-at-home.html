      <h2>Why Proper Glass Care Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Glass is widely used in homes for windows, tables, mirrors,
        doors, shelves, and decorative items.
        Although glass looks strong, it can easily scratch, stain,
        or lose its clarity if not cleaned and handled correctly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regular and proper care keeps glass surfaces clear,
        improves home appearance, and helps prevent cracks
        or permanent damage over time.
      </p>

      <h2>General Rules for Caring for Glass Surfaces</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean glass regularly to prevent dust buildup</li>
        <li>Use soft cloths instead of abrasive materials</li>
        <li>Avoid harsh chemicals unless necessary</li>
        <li>Dry glass completely to prevent water spots</li>
        <li>Handle glass items carefully to avoid impact</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Clean Glass Safely and Effectively</h2>
      <p>
        The safest way to clean glass is by using warm water
        mixed with mild dish soap or a vinegar solution.
        Spray lightly and wipe using a microfiber cloth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always clean glass in circular motions,
        then finish with vertical strokes to prevent streaks.
        Avoid cleaning glass under direct sunlight,
        as it can cause streaking.

      <h2>Best Way to Clean Windows at Home</h2>
      <p>
        For windows, remove dust first using a dry cloth.
        Then clean using a gentle glass cleaner or vinegar solution.
        Wipe frames and edges carefully,
        as dirt often accumulates in these areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cleaning windows regularly improves natural light
        and helps detect cracks or seal damage early.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Care for Glass Tables and Shelves</h2>
      <p>
        Glass tables and shelves are prone to fingerprints,
        scratches, and pressure damage.
        Always use coasters under drinks
        and avoid placing heavy objects directly on the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use table mats and felt pads to protect glass
        from scratches caused by movement or vibration.
      </p>

      <h2>Maintaining Mirrors Without Damage</h2>
      <p>
        Mirrors require gentle care to prevent black spots
        and edge corrosion.
        Avoid spraying cleaner directly onto the mirror surface.
        Instead, spray onto a cloth and wipe gently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep mirrors away from excess moisture,
        especially in bathrooms with poor ventilation.

      <h2>Preventing Scratches on Glass Surfaces</h2>
      <p>
        Scratches are one of the most common glass problems.
        Never use abrasive sponges or rough paper towels.
        Always choose microfiber cloths or soft cotton fabric.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lift glass items instead of dragging them,
        and avoid stacking glass objects directly on each other.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Remove Stubborn Glass Stains</h2>
      <p>
        Hard water stains and grease can make glass look cloudy.
        A mixture of vinegar and baking soda
        can help dissolve stubborn residue safely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apply gently, rinse thoroughly,
        and dry immediately to restore clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Replace Damaged Glass?</h2>
      <p>
        Small scratches are often cosmetic,
        but cracks or chipped edges can weaken glass significantly.
        Replace damaged glass promptly to prevent injury
        and further breakage.
