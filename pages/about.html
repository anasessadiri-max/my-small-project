    <h1>About HomeFix Guide</h1>

    <p>
      HomeFix Guide is an informational website created to help homeowners,
      renters, and everyday people understand common household problems
      in a clear, simple, and practical way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many issues at home—such as unpleasant odors, humidity, weak internet,
      strange noises, or kitchen and maintenance problems—can be confusing,
      stressful, and sometimes expensive if misunderstood.
      Our mission is to explain <strong>why these problems happen</strong>
      and <strong>what steps you can take</strong> before they become serious.
    </p>

    <p>
      We focus on real questions that people search for every day.
      Instead of using complicated technical language,
      HomeFix Guide breaks problems down into easy-to-understand explanations
      and practical guidance that anyone can follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our content is carefully written to be helpful,
      neutral, and educational.
      While we strive for accuracy and clarity,
      all information on this website is provided
      for general informational purposes only
      and should not be considered professional or technical advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      HomeFix Guide does not promote unnecessary repairs or services.
      We believe that understanding a problem is the first step
      toward solving it wisely and safely.
    </p>

    <p>
      By focusing on clarity, simplicity, and real-life situations,
      HomeFix Guide aims to be a trusted resource
      for anyone looking to better understand their home.
