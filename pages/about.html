    <h1>About HomeFix Guide</h1>

    <p>
      HomeFix Guide was created to help people understand common household problems
      in a simple and practical way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many home issues—such as bad smells, strange noises, or sudden utility problems—
      can be confusing and frustrating. Our goal is to explain why these problems happen
      and what you can do about them.
