      <h2>Why Do Insects Appear Inside Homes?</h2>
      <p>
        Insects enter homes searching for food,
        water, and shelter.
        Crumbs, open food containers,
        moisture, and cracks in walls
        make houses attractive to pests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seasonal changes can also drive insects indoors,
        especially during cold or rainy weather.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Common Household Insects</h2>

        Insects are not just annoying;
