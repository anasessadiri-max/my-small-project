      <h2>Why Furniture Care Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Furniture is one of the most valuable investments in any home.
        Without proper care, even high-quality furniture can lose its appearance,
        comfort, and strength over time.
        Dust, moisture, sunlight, and daily use slowly damage surfaces if ignored.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proper furniture care not only keeps your home looking clean and organized
        but also helps you avoid expensive replacements in the future.

      <h2>How to Take Care of Wooden Furniture</h2>
      <p>
        Wooden furniture is durable but sensitive to moisture and temperature changes.
        Dust wooden surfaces weekly using a soft, dry cloth.
        Avoid excessive water, as it can cause swelling and warping.
      </p>

      <p>
        To maintain shine and prevent cracks,

      <h2>Proper Care for Upholstered Furniture</h2>
      <p>
        Sofas and chairs with fabric upholstery collect dust, crumbs, and odors over time.
        Vacuum upholstered furniture weekly using an upholstery attachment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clean spills immediately to prevent stains.
        Use mild fabric cleaners and avoid soaking the material,
        as excess moisture can damage the padding underneath.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Maintain Leather Furniture</h2>
      <p>
        Leather furniture requires special care to stay soft and crack-free.
        Wipe leather surfaces with a slightly damp cloth to remove dust.
        Never use harsh chemicals or alcohol-based cleaners.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apply leather conditioner every few months to keep the material flexible
        and prevent drying and cracking.
      </p>

      <h2>Protecting Furniture from Sunlight Damage</h2>
      <p>
        Direct sunlight can fade colors and weaken furniture materials.
        Position furniture away from windows whenever possible.
        Use curtains or blinds to reduce sun exposure during peak hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rotating furniture occasionally helps prevent uneven fading.

      <p>
        Use protective pads under furniture legs to avoid scratching floors.
        Place coasters under drinks and mats under hot items.
        Avoid dragging furniture across the floor.
      </p>

        Small habits like these can significantly extend the life of your furniture.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Deal with Furniture Odors</h2>
      <p>
        Furniture can absorb odors from food, pets, and moisture.
        Baking soda is an effective natural deodorizer for fabric furniture.
        Sprinkle lightly, let it sit, then vacuum thoroughly.
      </p>

      <p>
        For wooden furniture, proper ventilation and regular cleaning
        help prevent unpleasant smells.
