      <!-- Quick Answer -->
      <p class="quick-answer">
        A high electricity bill is usually caused by inefficient appliances,
        increased seasonal usage, poor insulation, or devices consuming power even when turned off.

      <h2>Common Reasons for High Electricity Bills</h2>

      <h3>Old or Inefficient Appliances</h3>
      <p>
        Older appliances use significantly more electricity than modern energy-efficient models.
        Refrigerators, air conditioners, and electric heaters are often the main contributors.
      </p>

      <h3>Devices Left Plugged In</h3>
      <p>
        Many electronics continue to consume power even when not in use.
        This hidden usage is known as standby or phantom power.

      <h3>Poor Home Insulation</h3>
      <p>
        Homes with poor insulation require more energy for heating and cooling,
        especially during summer and winter months.
      </p>

      <h3>Seasonal Energy Usage</h3>
      <p>
        Electricity consumption often increases during extreme weather.
        Air conditioners in summer and electric heaters in winter can double your energy usage.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Reduce Your Electricity Bill</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Replace old appliances with energy-efficient models</li>
        <li>Unplug electronics when not in use</li>
        <li>Improve insulation around doors and windows</li>
        <li>Use LED lighting instead of traditional bulbs</li>
        <li>Monitor your electricity usage regularly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Should You Contact an Electrician?</h2>
      <p>
        If your electricity bill keeps increasing despite reduced usage,
        there may be wiring issues or hidden electrical faults that require professional inspection.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Why did my electricity bill suddenly increase?</h3>
        <p style="display:none;">
          Sudden increases are often caused by seasonal changes, new appliances,
          or devices consuming power in standby mode.
        </p>

        <h3>Can faulty wiring increase electricity costs?</h3>
        <p style="display:none;">
          Yes. Faulty or outdated wiring can cause energy loss and increase your monthly bill.
