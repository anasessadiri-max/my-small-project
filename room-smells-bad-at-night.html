<h2>Why Rooms Smell Worse at Night</h2>

<h3>Poor Air Circulation</h3>
<p>
At night, windows are usually closed and airflow decreases,
allowing odors to build up inside the room.
</p>

<h3>Humidity and Trapped Moisture</h3>
<p>
Moisture released during the day can become noticeable at night,
especially in rooms with poor ventilation.
