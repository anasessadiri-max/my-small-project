      <h2>Why Proper Storage of Opened Canned Food Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Canned foods are designed to last a long time
        while sealed, but once opened,
        they become vulnerable to air,
        bacteria, and contamination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Improper storage after opening
        can lead to food spoilage,
        unpleasant odors,
        loss of taste,
        and even food poisoning.
        Understanding the correct storage methods
        helps protect your health
        and reduce food waste.
      </p>

      <h2>What Happens When a Can Is Opened?</h2>
      <p>
        When a can is opened,
        the protective seal is broken,
        allowing oxygen and microorganisms
        to come into contact with the food.
      </p>

      <p>
        Metal cans are not designed
        for long-term food storage after opening.
        Exposure to air and moisture
        can cause chemical reactions
        that affect taste and safety.
      </p>

      <h2>Should You Store Food in the Open Can?</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most common mistakes
        is storing leftover food
        directly inside the opened can.
        This practice is not recommended.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once opened,
        metal cans may react with food,
        especially acidic items like tomatoes or fruits,
        causing metallic flavors
        and faster spoilage.

      <h2>Best Way to Store Canned Food After Opening</h2>
      <p>
        The safest method
        is transferring the food immediately
        into a clean, airtight container.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use glass or food-grade plastic containers</li>
        <li>Ensure the container has a tight-fitting lid</li>
        <li>Label the container with the opening date</li>
        <li>Place it in the refrigerator promptly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Long Does Opened Canned Food Last?</h2>
      <p>
        Storage time depends on the type of food,
        but most opened canned foods
        should be consumed within
        2 to 4 days when refrigerated.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vegetables: 3–4 days</li>
        <li>Beans and legumes: 3–4 days</li>
        <li>Fish and meat: 1–2 days</li>
        <li>Fruits: 2–3 days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Storing Different Types of Canned Foods</h2>

      <h3>Canned Vegetables</h3>
      <p>
        Drain excess liquid,
        store in an airtight container,
        and refrigerate immediately.
        Avoid leaving vegetables
        at room temperature after opening.
      </p>

      <h3>Canned Meat and Fish</h3>
      <p>
        These foods spoil faster
        and should be consumed quickly.
        Always keep them tightly sealed
        and refrigerated.
      </p>

      <h3>Canned Fruits</h3>
      <p>
        Fruits stored in syrup
        may last slightly longer,
        but should still be transferred
        to a separate container
        to maintain freshness.
