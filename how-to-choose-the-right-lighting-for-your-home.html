      <h2>Why Proper Lighting Is Important in a Home</h2>
      <p>
        Lighting plays a major role in how a home looks and feels.
        Good lighting enhances comfort,
        supports daily activities,
        and improves overall interior design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poor lighting can cause eye strain,
        reduce productivity,
        and make spaces feel small or uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the Main Types of Home Lighting</h2>
      <p>
        A well-lit home usually combines
        several types of lighting.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ambient lighting:</strong> General light for the entire room</li>
        <li><strong>Task lighting:</strong> Focused light for activities like reading or cooking</li>
        <li><strong>Accent lighting:</strong> Decorative light to highlight features</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Choose the Right Brightness Level</h2>
      <p>
        Brightness is measured in lumens.
        Each room requires a different brightness level
        depending on its purpose.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Living rooms: Medium brightness</li>
        <li>Kitchens: Bright task lighting</li>
        <li>Bedrooms: Soft and relaxing light</li>
        <li>Bathrooms: Bright but balanced lighting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Choosing the Right Color Temperature</h2>
      <p>
        Light color temperature affects mood and comfort.
        It is measured in Kelvin (K).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warm light (2700K–3000K):</strong> Cozy and relaxing</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral light (3500K–4000K):</strong> Balanced and natural</li>
        <li><strong>Cool light (5000K+):</strong> Bright and energizing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Warm light is ideal for living rooms and bedrooms,
        while cooler light works better in kitchens and offices.
      </p>

      <h2>Room-by-Room Lighting Tips</h2>
      <p>
        Each room has unique lighting needs.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Living room:</strong> Combine ambient and accent lighting</li>
        <li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Use strong task lighting over work areas</li>
        <li><strong>Bedroom:</strong> Choose soft lights with bedside lamps</li>
        <li><strong>Bathroom:</strong> Use even lighting around mirrors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Energy-Efficient Lighting Options</h2>
      <p>
        Modern lighting solutions can reduce energy costs
        and environmental impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        LED bulbs consume less electricity,
        last longer,
        and produce less heat
        compared to traditional bulbs.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Lighting Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <p>
        Many homeowners make simple mistakes
        that reduce lighting effectiveness.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Using a single light source in large rooms</li>
        <li>Choosing bulbs that are too bright or too dim</li>
        <li>Ignoring natural light</li>
        <li>Using the wrong color temperature</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Should You Upgrade Your Home Lighting?</h2>
      <p>
        If your home feels dark,
        outdated,
        or uncomfortable,
        upgrading lighting can make a big difference.
      </p>
