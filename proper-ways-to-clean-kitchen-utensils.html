      <h2>Why Proper Cleaning of Kitchen Utensils Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Kitchen utensils are in constant contact with food,
        water, and hands.
        Without proper cleaning,
        they can quickly become a breeding ground for bacteria,
        grease buildup, and food residue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poorly cleaned utensils increase the risk of food poisoning,
        unpleasant odors, and cross-contamination.
        Over time, incorrect cleaning methods
        can also damage cookware,
        reduce performance,
        and shorten its lifespan.
      </p>

      <h2>General Rules for Cleaning Kitchen Utensils</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash utensils immediately after use whenever possible</li>
        <li>Use warm water and mild dish soap</li>
        <li>Separate utensils used for raw meat from other dishes</li>
        <li>Use different sponges for dishes and surfaces</li>
        <li>Dry utensils completely before storage</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Clean Stainless Steel Utensils Properly</h2>
      <p>
        Stainless steel utensils are durable,
        resistant to rust,
        and widely used in kitchens.
        However, improper cleaning can cause scratches,
        water spots, or discoloration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clean stainless steel using warm water and mild detergent.
        Avoid steel wool or abrasive scrubbers.
        For stubborn stains,
        a paste made from baking soda and water
        can gently restore shine.

      <h2>Cleaning Non-Stick Cookware Safely</h2>
      <p>
        Non-stick cookware requires extra care
        to preserve the coating.
        Never use metal utensils,
        sharp tools,
        or rough sponges on non-stick surfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always allow non-stick cookware to cool
        before washing to prevent warping.
        Use a soft sponge with mild soap
        and avoid dishwashers
        unless clearly marked as dishwasher-safe.
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices for Cleaning Wooden Utensils</h2>
      <p>
        Wooden utensils are naturally porous,
        meaning they absorb moisture and odors easily.
        This makes proper cleaning essential
        to prevent bacteria growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wash wooden utensils by hand using warm water and mild soap,
        then dry them immediately.
        Never soak wooden utensils for long periods
        or place them in a dishwasher.
      </p>

      <p>
        To keep wood in good condition,
        apply food-grade mineral oil once a month
        to prevent cracking and drying.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Clean Plastic Utensils Effectively</h2>
      <p>
        Plastic utensils are lightweight and affordable
        but can stain and absorb odors over time.
        Prompt cleaning after use
        helps prevent permanent discoloration.
      </p>

      <p>
        For deep cleaning,
        soak plastic utensils in warm water
        mixed with baking soda.
        Avoid extremely hot water,
        especially with low-quality plastic,
        as it may warp or release harmful chemicals.

      <h2>How to Sanitize Kitchen Utensils Safely</h2>
      <p>
        Sanitizing is especially important
        after handling raw meat, poultry, or seafood.
        Sanitization removes harmful microorganisms
        that regular washing may not eliminate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Safe sanitizing methods include
        diluted vinegar solutions
        or food-safe bleach solutions.
        Always rinse utensils thoroughly
        with clean water after sanitizing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dishwashers with high-temperature or sanitizing cycles
        are also effective for sanitizing
        dishwasher-safe utensils.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Kitchen Utensil Cleaning Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using one sponge for all utensils</li>
        <li>Ignoring cracks, chips, or peeling coatings</li>
        <li>Storing utensils while still wet</li>
        <li>Using harsh chemicals unnecessarily</li>
        <li>Overlooking deep cleaning routines</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Often Should Kitchen Utensils Be Cleaned?</h2>
      <p>
        Kitchen utensils should be cleaned
        after every single use.
        Items such as cutting boards,
        knives,
        and cooking spoons
        should never be reused without washing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deep cleaning and sanitizing
        should be performed weekly,
        especially in busy kitchens.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Replace Old Kitchen Utensils?</h2>
      <p>
        Replace kitchen utensils
        that show deep cracks,
        peeling non-stick coatings,
        warping,
        or persistent odors.
      </p>

      <p>
        These signs indicate that bacteria
        may be trapped inside the material,
        making the utensil unsafe
        for food preparation.
      </p>
