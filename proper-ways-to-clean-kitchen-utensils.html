      <h2>Why Proper Cleaning of Kitchen Utensils Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Kitchen utensils come into direct contact with food every day.
        Improper cleaning can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria,
        cross-contamination, and unpleasant odors.
        Over time, poor cleaning habits can also damage cookware,
        shorten its lifespan, and affect food taste.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding how to clean different types of utensils correctly
        is essential for maintaining a healthy kitchen environment.
      </p>

      <h2>General Rules for Cleaning Kitchen Utensils</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash utensils immediately after use whenever possible</li>
        <li>Use warm water and mild dish soap</li>
        <li>Avoid mixing raw meat utensils with other dishes</li>
        <li>Dry utensils completely before storage</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Clean Stainless Steel Utensils</h2>
      <p>
        Stainless steel utensils are durable and resistant to rust,
        but they still require proper care.
        Use warm water and mild detergent,
        and avoid steel wool or abrasive sponges that may scratch the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        For stubborn stains or discoloration,
        a mixture of baking soda and water works effectively.
        Gently scrub the surface, rinse thoroughly,
        and dry immediately to prevent water spots.

      <h2>Cleaning Non-Stick Cookware Safely</h2>
      <p>
        Non-stick utensils require special attention.
        Never use metal tools or harsh scrubbers,
        as they can damage the non-stick coating.
        Always allow cookware to cool before washing to prevent warping.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use a soft sponge with mild dish soap,
        and avoid dishwasher cleaning unless the manufacturer states it is safe.
      </p>

      <h2>Best Way to Clean Wooden Utensils</h2>
      <p>
        Wooden utensils absorb moisture easily,
        making them prone to bacteria growth if not cleaned correctly.
        Wash wooden utensils by hand using warm water and mild soap,
        then dry them immediately with a towel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never soak wooden utensils in water for long periods.
        To maintain their condition,
        apply food-grade mineral oil once a month.
      </p>

      <h2>Cleaning Plastic Utensils Properly</h2>
      <p>
        Plastic utensils can develop stains and odors over time.
        Washing them promptly after use helps prevent this.
        For deep cleaning,
        soak plastic utensils in a solution of baking soda and warm water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid using extremely hot water on low-quality plastic,
        as it may warp or release harmful chemicals.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Sanitize Kitchen Utensils</h2>
      <p>
        Sanitizing utensils is especially important after handling raw meat.
        One effective method is using a diluted vinegar or food-safe bleach solution.
        Always rinse thoroughly with clean water after sanitizing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dishwashers can also sanitize utensils effectively
        if they have a high-temperature or sanitizing cycle.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the same sponge for all utensils</li>
        <li>Ignoring cracks or damaged utensils</li>
        <li>Storing utensils while still wet</li>
        <li>Using harsh chemicals unnecessarily</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Often Should You Clean Kitchen Utensils?</h2>
      <p>
        Utensils should be cleaned after every use.
        Items like cutting boards, knives,
        and cooking spoons should never be reused without washing.
        Deep cleaning and sanitizing should be done weekly.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Replace Old Utensils?</h2>
      <p>
        Replace utensils that show deep cracks,
        peeling coatings, or persistent odors.
        These signs indicate that bacteria may be trapped inside,
        making them unsafe for food preparation.
