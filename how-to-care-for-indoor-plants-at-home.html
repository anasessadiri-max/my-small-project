      <h2>Why Indoor Plant Care Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Indoor plants add beauty, improve air quality,
        and create a calming atmosphere in your home.
        However, without proper care, plants can weaken,
        stop growing, or eventually die.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding basic plant needs helps prevent common problems
        such as yellow leaves, root rot, and slow growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Basic Rules for Caring for Indoor Plants</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose plants suitable for your home environment</li>
        <li>Provide proper lighting based on plant type</li>
        <li>Water plants only when needed</li>
        <li>Use well-draining soil and pots</li>
        <li>Remove dead or damaged leaves regularly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Often Should You Water Indoor Plants?</h2>
      <p>
        Overwatering is one of the most common mistakes in plant care.
        Always check the soil before watering.
        If the top layer of soil feels dry, it is usually safe to water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Make sure excess water can drain out of the pot
        to prevent root rot and fungal problems.

      <h2>Understanding Light Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Light is essential for plant growth,
        but different plants need different light levels.
        Some thrive in bright indirect light,
        while others tolerate low-light conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Placing a plant in the wrong lighting
        can cause weak stems, leaf loss, or slow growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Choosing the Right Soil and Pots</h2>
      <p>
        Healthy roots depend on proper soil.
        Always use well-draining potting soil
        designed for indoor plants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pots should have drainage holes
        to allow excess water to escape.
        Repot plants every one to two years
        to refresh nutrients.
      </p>

      <h2>Maintaining Temperature and Humidity</h2>
      <p>
        Most indoor plants grow best in stable temperatures
        between 18 and 25 degrees Celsius.
        Avoid placing plants near heaters,
        air conditioners, or cold drafts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Increasing humidity can help tropical plants thrive,
        especially during dry seasons.

      <h2>Preventing Common Indoor Plant Problems</h2>
      <p>
        Watch for signs such as yellow leaves,
        brown edges, or pests.
        Early detection makes problems easier to fix.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clean leaves regularly to remove dust
        and allow better light absorption.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Replace or Repot a Plant?</h2>
      <p>
        If roots are growing out of the drainage holes
        or the plant stops growing,
        it may be time to repot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Severely damaged or diseased plants
        may need to be replaced
        to protect other plants in your home.
